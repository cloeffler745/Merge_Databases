create_metadata_files.py  
- creates two text files of metadata generated from our sql databases. one for fungi and one for bacteria. 
- future work should have the taxid and name liniage information included so that we may combine the fungi and bacteria metadata files into one file.

get_consensus_stats.py     
- This code collects and prints count and average lengths of reads. Useful for debugging and learning to work with the assembly tools.


our_sql_metadata_fungi.txt
-fungal metadata in text form from our sql databases

gather_data_fungi.sh
- this code is used to gather the genomic reference files for a given taxid (taxid must be provided as one of the inputs when the code is called on the command line) 
- future work should make this code no longer require user input
- " should also make use of the first_step.txt file generated and not copy over the entire reference file 
- this code requires "create_metadata_files.py" to have already been run.

our_sql_metadata_bact.txt  
- bacterial metadata in text form from our sql databases

run_assembly_tool.sh
- runs the wtdgb2 assembly tool
- future work on this code will make it reference first_step.txt file instead of getting databases

collect_reads.sh
- This creates a catinated file of all the references used as input reads for the assembler. Currently only works for fungi. 
- As it catinates them into one file, it edits the '>' lines by inserting dbname and filename (seperated by commas). This butts up against whatever was first in the line, which gets printed with the added metadata in the query template name column of the CIGAR bwa mem samtools output column ($1).
